Environmental Impact – Supports conservation efforts by reducing carbon footprints.

Approach

1. Data Understanding & Exploration

Load and explore the dataset to understand structure, variables, and quality.

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns, correlations, and outliers.

2. Data Preprocessing

Handle missing or inconsistent data.

Parse date and time into separate features.

Create additional features such as daily averages, peak hours, rolling averages.

Normalize or scale data for better model performance.

3. Feature Engineering

Identify key features influencing global active power consumption.

Incorporate external data (e.g., weather conditions) if available.

4. Model Selection & Training

Split dataset into training and testing sets.

Train regression models, including:

Linear Regression

Random Forest

Gradient Boosting

Neural Networks

Perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance.

5. Model Evaluation

Use key evaluation metrics:

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

R-Squared (R²)

Compare models and select the best performer.
