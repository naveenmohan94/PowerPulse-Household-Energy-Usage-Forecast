Problem Statement

Energy management is crucial for both households and energy providers. Predicting energy consumption accurately enables better planning, cost reduction, and resource optimization.

The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict household energy consumption based on historical data. This model will provide:

Insights for consumers to optimize energy usage.

Forecasting capabilities for energy providers to manage demand efficiently.

By completing this project, learners will:

Gain a deep understanding of energy usage trends.

Deliver a predictive model that optimizes energy consumption.

Establish a baseline for further research in energy management systems.

Business Use Cases

Energy Management for Households – Helps monitor energy usage and reduce bills.

Demand Forecasting for Energy Providers – Enables better load management and pricing strategies.

Anomaly Detection – Identifies irregular usage patterns indicating faults or unauthorized consumption.

Smart Grid Integration – Enhances predictive analytics for real-time energy optimization.

Environmental Impact – Supports conservation efforts by reducing carbon footprints.

Approach

1. Data Understanding & Exploration

Load and explore the dataset to understand structure, variables, and quality.

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns, correlations, and outliers.

2. Data Preprocessing

Handle missing or inconsistent data.

Parse date and time into separate features.

Create additional features such as daily averages, peak hours, rolling averages.

Normalize or scale data for better model performance.

3. Feature Engineering

Identify key features influencing global active power consumption.

Incorporate external data (e.g., weather conditions) if available.

4. Model Selection & Training

Split dataset into training and testing sets.

Train regression models, including:

Linear Regression

Random Forest

Gradient Boosting

Perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance.

5. Model Evaluation

Use key evaluation metrics:

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

R-Squared (R²)

Compare models and select the best performer.
